# The Playlist Miner 

In our project, we make use of the Web ApI created by Spotify so that our users could search for playlists
based on their mood. For example, give The Playlist Miner a keyword or two like "workout" or "happy" and The
Playlist Miner will find as many Spotify playlists that match those keywords. It will then aggregate
all of the songs across all of these playlists and find the top 100 songs that occur the
most frequently in the matching playlist. These top songs can then be saved
to your own playlist.
